## Introduction to HTML and How the Web Works

Understanding the Web
The World Wide Web is a system of interconnected documents and resources, accessed via the Internet. To comprehend how web development fits into this, it's essential to understand some 

* key components:

1. Client-Server Architecture:
The web operates on a client-server model.
Client: The user's device (computer, phone, tablet) running a web browser.
Server: A powerful computer that stores web files and delivers them to clients upon request.

2. HTTP/HTTPS:
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): The foundation of data communication on the web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted.
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure): The secure version of HTTP, ensuring encrypted communication. It is increasingly essential for security.

3. URL (Uniform Resource Locator):
A URL is the address used to access resources on the web. It includes the protocol (http/https), domain name, and path to the resource.


4. HTML as the Backbone:
HTML provides the structure for web content. Browsers interpret HTML documents received from servers and render them for users.


* How a Web Page is Loaded:

A user enters a URL in the browser or clicks on a link.

DNS Resolution:

The browser sends a request to a Domain Name System (DNS) server to translate the domain name to an IP address.

HTTP Request:

The browser sends an HTTP request to the server identified by the IP address.

Server Processing:

The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response containing the requested files.

Browser Rendering:

The browser interprets HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render the web page.

Display to User:

The rendered web page is displayed in the user's browser.


* Prerequisites:
Before diving into HTML, ensure you have a grasp of the following concepts:

Internet Basics: Understand how the Internet works, including concepts like IP addresses, DNS, and protocols (HTTP/HTTPS).

Client-Server Model: Familiarize yourself with the idea of clients and servers in web architecture.

URL Structure: Know how to interpret URLs and understand the components of a typical web address.

## Getting Started:

Start now with Installing and IDE (VScode)

Integrated development environment

* It's a comprehensive tool used by developers to write and test software
* We are going to use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) which is a popular IDE. It's a lightweight IDE developed by Microsoft, widely used for programming in various languages. 

* VS Code offers features like syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, and other imp features making it a versatile tool for developers.

* Download VS code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)



# Creating an account on GitHub
Create a personal account to get started with GitHub.
## [About your personal account on GitHub.com](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/creating-an-account-on-github#about-your-personal-account-on-githubcom)
To get started with GitHub, you’ll need to create a free personal account on GitHub.com and verify your email address.
Every person who uses GitHub.com signs in to a personal account. Your personal account is your identity on GitHub.com and has a username and profile. For example, see [@octocat’s profile](https://github.com/octocat).
Later, you can explore the different types of accounts that GitHub offers, and decide if you need a billing plan. For more information, see “[Types of GitHub accounts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts)” and “[GitHub’s plans](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans).”
Note that the steps in this article don’t apply to Enterprise Managed Users. If your GitHub account has been created for you by your company, you can skip this article and continue to “[Hello World](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world).”
## [Signing up for a new personal account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/creating-an-account-on-github#signing-up-for-a-new-personal-account)
1. Navigate to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/).
2. Click **Sign up**.
3. Follow the prompts to create your personal account.
During sign up, you’ll be asked to verify your email address. Without a verified email address, you won’t be able to complete some basic GitHub tasks, such as creating a repository.
If you’re having problems verifying your email address, there are some troubleshooting steps you can take. For more information, see “[Verifying your email address](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/verifying-your-email-address#troubleshooting-email-verification).”
## [Next steps](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/creating-an-account-on-github#next-steps)
- Now that you’ve created your personal account, we’ll start to explore the basics of GitHub. In the following tutorial, “[Hello World](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world),” you’ll learn about repositories and how to create one, and you’ll be introduced to concepts such as branching, commits, and pull requests.
- We strongly recommend that you configure 2FA for your account. 2FA is an extra layer of security that can help keep your account secure. For more information, see “[Configuring two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication).”









Familiarize yourself with the client-server model and how browsers interact with servers.
Experiment with entering different URLs in your browser to observe how web pages are loaded.

Remember, HTML is just the beginning. As you progress, you'll explore more technologies like CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, enabling you to create dynamic and engaging web pages.






Happy exploring! and See you in the Class!!
