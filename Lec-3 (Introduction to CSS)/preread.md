### Understanding CSS: A Brief Overview

CSS is a styling language that complements HTML, allowing developers to control the visual presentation and layout of web pages. By separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), developers can create aesthetically pleasing and responsive websites.

Targets elements of a specific type, allowing for consistent styling across a website.

#### Class Selector (`.`)

Styles elements with a shared class attribute, facilitating the application of styles to multiple elements.

#### ID Selector (`#`)

Applies styles to a unique element with a specific ID attribute, ensuring a distinct visual presentation.

#### Descendant Selector

Selects elements that are descendants of a specified parent, offering a way to style nested structures.
